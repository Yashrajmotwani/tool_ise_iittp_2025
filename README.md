# VS Code Complexity Visualizer Extension

This VS Code extension integrates static code analysis using **Lizard** to visualize cyclomatic complexity of code. It overlays a heatmap directly on the editor to highlight areas of code with different complexity levels, helping developers identify complex functions easily. Additionally, the extension includes a WebView panel to display cyclomatic complexity and NLOC in an interactive table.

## Features

- **Heatmap Overlay**: Visualizes code complexity in the editor with color-coded highlights:
  - Green: Low complexity 
  - Yellow: Medium complexity 
  - Red: High complexity 
  
- **WebView Panel**: Displays a table with the following data:
  - **Line Numbers (Range)**: Start and end line numbers of each function.
  - **Function Name**: Name of the function.
  - **NLOC**: Lines of Code in the function.
  - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Calculated cyclomatic complexity score.
  - **Color Representation**: Color assigned based on complexity score.

- **Toggle Heatmap**: Easily toggle the visibility of the heatmap overlay with the button in the WebView.

## Usage

1. Open a supported code file list given in below table.
2. Use the **Analyze Complexity** command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. The extension will run Lizard and display complexity data:
   - The editor will show a heatmap with color-coded complexity scores.
   - The WebView will display a detailed table of function complexities.
4. Toggle the heatmap visibility using the toggle button in the WebView panel.

ðŸ’¡ **Hover Tooltips**  
  Hover over any colored region to instantly view the **cyclomatic complexity score** of the function.

ðŸ“Š **General Cyclomatic Complexity Ranges** (based on Lizard and industry norms)

| Score Range | Complexity Level | Description                                            |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1â€“5         | Low              | Simple, easy to understand and test                   |
| 6â€“10        | Moderate         | Manageable, but may benefit from simplification       |
| 11â€“20       | High             | Complex, harder to test, consider refactoring         |
| 21â€“50       | Very High        | Very complex, likely needs major refactoring          |
| > 50        | Extreme          | Unmaintainable, high risk for bugs                    |
